# Romance Breaker
##### "Is your girlfriend/boyfriend complaining that you wake up too late every morning or that you are not romantic enough but of course you're too lazy to change? I have a solution for you."  
  
Introducing *Romance Breaker*, a small python script which sends a custom morning message from a list to your significant other every morning at a given time range on Facebook Messenger or WhatsApp, now doesn't this sound great already?

### Most loved features:
  - You can still be lazy
  - You can still wake up late
  - Relationship improvement (I don't take any responsibility if Romance Breaker® doesn't improve relationship status)
  - Magic

### [NEW]: Windows users can now use the graphical version of RomanceBreaker:

# Usage
First go to the program directory by typing in the terminal:
- From **PC:**  ```cd RomanceBreaker``` 
- From **Android:** ```cd storage/downloads/RomanceBreaker```  

Then run the script with the according argument:  
- For **WhatsApp version**: ```python romanceBreaker.py -w``` or ```python romanceBreaker.py whatsapp``` 
- For **Messenger version**: ```python romanceBreaker.py -m``` or ```python romanceBreaker.py messenger``` 
- For **SMS version**: ```python romanceBreaker.py -s``` or ```python romanceBreaker.py sms``` 

Also other arguments exist like:
- To open **user guide**: ```python romanceBreaker.py -h``` or ```python romanceBreaker.py help```  or ```python romanceBreaker.py man``` 
- To **update** the script: ```python romanceBreaker.py update```

**For *Android* users:** you will also need to press ```"ACQUIRE WAKELOCK"``` in the Termux notification to enable the script to run in the background withoutthe process being killed  
***Android right now only supports Facebook Messenger mode***
Simply ```cd RomanceBreaker``` and ```python WA-RomanceBreaker.py```  

# Custom messages/times setup
***Android** users may want to edit the ```config.py``` file with their preferred text editing app as the file will be in the Downloads folder of their devices*   
  
Simply open the ```config.py``` file with your preferred text editing app and follow the instructions there, I think I made them clear enough   
###### If you still cannot understand from the config.py file..
## Custom messages:


Replace the messages in between ```" "``` with your own custom messages, you can also add more custom messages by adding after the ```"``` of the last message a comma and a new message, always in between ```" "```s. 
If we want to add ```New custom message``` to the list below 
```python
custom_morning_messages = ["Good morning beautiful ♥♥♥"]
```
We just need to edit it like this:
```python
custom_morning_messages = ["Good morning beautiful ♥♥♥", "New custom message"]
```
## Custom time range: 

If we want to change the time range we have to edit this line:
```python
custom_time_interval = ["04:20", "16:20"]
```

Make sure the **hour** is always **two digits**
